# Console Application for Image Triggered File Upload (Hypothetical)

This console application demonstrates the concept of initiating file upload processes in a console environment based on triggers that would normally be used in a GUI, such as clicking an image. Since console applications do not support direct GUI-based interactions like image clicks, this documentation will describe a hypothetical scenario or simulate this with command-line options.

## Features

 - File Upload Trigger: Simulates an action that would typically be triggered by a GUI event (e.g., clicking an image) using command-line arguments or interactive console inputs.
 - Modular Code: Demonstrates clean and modular coding practices for handling file inputs and outputs.
 - Unit Testing: Includes unit tests using NUnit to verify the logic of file upload triggers.
 - Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:

 - .NET 5.0 SDK or higher (required to build and run the C# console application)
 - Visual Studio (recommended for developing and running NUnit tests, but not strictly necessary if you prefer other IDEs or editors)
